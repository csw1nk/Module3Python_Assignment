## Corey Swink Assignment for Module 3 Python
## source files are located in each folder PyBank, PyPoll
## files are named main.py
## resources for each file are in resources folder, each main.py load its appropriate csv file
## I understand the assignment wanted the PyBank output in .txt but i did csv, i saw those instructions after the fact but the i did change the PyPoll.
## Thoughts
This was a good learning about reading and writing csv using a python library, also writing to txt files. The analysis portion seemed relevant a fitting that there was a small data set for PyBank - time and value and we were able to create a few meaningful variables and create some KPIs
The PyPoll was tougher than i thought, having to loop to find the results for each candidate was the more difficult part but understand how it works better now doing this assignment. we could have ton more with these scripts and analysis using visualization in matplotlib.
